- Version: [1.0.9]

### New Features:

Recent Files History: We have added a new "Recent Files" feature to the application, which allows users to quickly access files they have recently opened. This feature will automatically save the user's file access history and display a list of recent files when the application starts, making it easier for users to resume their previous work.

### Improvements:

Improved file loading speed to ensure users can access files faster.
Enhanced the user interface to make the "Recent Files" list more intuitive and user-friendly.
