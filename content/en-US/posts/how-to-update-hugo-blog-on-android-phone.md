With the development of Internet technology, static blogs have become increasingly popular among bloggers due to their lightweight and efficient nature. However, due to the lack of backend support, static blog programs such as HUGO, HEXO, Jekyll, etc., often appear inconvenient when publishing articles. Traditional methods usually require complex operations on a PC, which is undoubtedly a restriction for bloggers who wish to record the details of their lives at any time.

### Traditional Solutions and Their Limitations

## Direct Operation on GitHub

Although GitHub allows users to create and modify files directly on its website, the issue of unstable access within China frequently interrupts the continuity of creation, especially when network fluctuations occur during editing, which can lead to the loss of unsaved work.

## StackEdit

This online Markdown editor supports private deployment and binding with GitHub repositories, making it suitable for quick editing on mobile devices. However, the limitation of not supporting image uploads restricts content creation, particularly for bloggers who rely on visual elements to enrich their articles.

## Weblog App

As an Android application designed specifically for Hugo, HEXO, and other blog frameworks, Weblog offers a relatively complete mobile solution, including file management and Git integration. However, it also faces the problem of inconvenient image processing, requiring the use of additional tools to complete comprehensive blog updates.

## Code-server

This browser-based development environment provides convenience for remote collaboration, especially suitable for seamless switching between multiple devices. However, server costs and network latency may pose obstacles in its usage.
